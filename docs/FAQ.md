Synalinks is a framework for building AI-driven programs using large language models (LLMs). It provides a structured approach to defining inputs, outputs, and program logic, making it easier to build, test, and deploy LLM-powered applications.

### What kinds of applications can I build with Synalinks?

Synalinks is versatile and can be used for a wide range of applications, including:

- Question answering systems
- Content generation
- Text classification
- Information extraction
- Multi-step reasoning
- Chatbots and conversational agents
- Document analysis
- And much more

### What languages does Synalinks support?

Synalinks is a Python library and primarily supports Python 3.9 and above.

### Is Synalinks open source?

Yes, Synalinks is open source and released under the MIT license.

## Setup and Installation

### How do I install Synalinks?

You can install Synalinks using pip:

```bash
pip install synalinks
```

Or using uv (recommended for better dependency management):

```bash
uv pip install synalinks
```

### What are the system requirements for Synalinks?

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Sufficient RAM to run language models (at least 8GB recommended)
- API keys for language model providers (if using hosted services)

### Can I use Synalinks offline?

Yes, Synalinks can be used with local language models like those available through Ollama or local deployments of open source models.

## Language Models

### Which language models does Synalinks support?

Synalinks supports a variety of language models:

- OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo)
- Anthropic models (Claude 3 family)
- Local models through Ollama
- Custom model integrations

### How do I configure API keys for language models?

You can set API keys through environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Or directly in your code:

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
```

### How can I switch between different language models?

Synalinks makes it easy to switch models by changing the language model instance:

```python
# Using OpenAI
language_model = synalinks.language_models.OpenAILanguageModel(
    model="gpt-4",
    temperature=0.7
)

# Or using Anthropic
language_model = synalinks.language_models.AnthropicLanguageModel(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    temperature=0.5
)
```

## Programming with Synalinks

### What's the difference between the functional, class-based, and Sequential APIs?

- **Functional API**: Simplest approach, great for straightforward programs defined with a single function
- **Class-based API**: More flexible, allows for complex state management and custom behavior
- **Sequential API**: Perfect for linear pipeline processing where each step takes input from the previous step

### How do I handle errors in Synalinks programs?

Synalinks provides error handling mechanisms through try/except blocks. You can also implement custom error handlers:

```python
try:
    result = await program(input_data)
except synalinks.exceptions.LanguageModelError as e:
    print(f"Language model error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

### Can I use Synalinks with asynchronous code?

Yes, Synalinks is designed to work with Python's asyncio. All program calls are asynchronous by default:

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    result = await program(input_data)
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Data Models

### What are DataModels in Synalinks?

DataModels define the structure of inputs and outputs for your programs. They are built on Pydantic models and provide validation, serialization, and documentation for your data.

### How do I create custom DataModels?

```python
from synalinks import DataModel, Field
from typing import List, Optional

class CustomInput(DataModel):
    text: str = Field(description="The input text")
    options: Optional[List[str]] = Field(None, description="Optional processing options")
```

### Can I nest DataModels?

Yes, DataModels can be nested:

```python
class Address(DataModel):
    street: str = Field(description="Street address")
    city: str = Field(description="City name")
    
class Person(DataModel):
    name: str = Field(description="Person's name")
    address: Address = Field(description="Person's address")
```

## Performance and Scaling

### How can I optimize the performance of my Synalinks programs?

- Use caching for language model calls
- Implement batching for multiple inputs
- Choose appropriate models based on the task complexity
- Use streaming for long-running generations

### Does Synalinks support parallel processing?

Yes, you can process multiple inputs in parallel using asyncio:

```python
async def process_batch(inputs):
    tasks = [program(input_item) for input_item in inputs]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results
```

### How can I deploy Synalinks at scale?

Synalinks can be deployed using:
- FastAPI for REST API services
- Docker containers for consistent environments
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Cloud services for managed deployments

## Training and Evaluation

### Can I train my Synalinks programs?

Yes, Synalinks provides training capabilities:

```python
program.compile(
    reward=synalinks.rewards.ExactMatch(in_mask=["answer"]),
    optimizer=synalinks.optimizers.RandomFewShot()
)

await program.fit(
    x_train,
    y_train,
    validation_data=(x_test, y_test),
    batch_size=32,
    epochs=10,
)
```

### How do I evaluate the performance of my programs?

Synalinks includes evaluation tools:

```python
from synalinks.evaluation import Evaluator
from synalinks.metrics import AccuracyMetric

evaluator = Evaluator(
    metrics=[AccuracyMetric()],
    model=program
)

results = await evaluator.evaluate(test_dataset)
print(f"Accuracy: {results['accuracy']:.2f}")
```

## Troubleshooting

### My language model calls are failing. What should I check?

1. Verify your API keys are correct and have sufficient quota
2. Check your internet connection if using cloud-based models
3. Ensure your prompts aren't hitting token limits
4. Look for rate limiting issues in the error messages

### How can I debug my Synalinks programs?

Synalinks provides logging and tracing capabilities:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Enable tracing for your program
with synalinks.utils.tracing_enabled(program):
    result = await program(input_data)
```

### Why am I getting serialization errors with my DataModels?

Common causes:
1. Using types that can't be JSON serialized
2. Circular references in nested models
3. Using complex Python objects without proper serialization handlers

## Integration and Deployment

### Can I use Synalinks with other Python libraries?

Yes, Synalinks is designed to integrate well with the Python ecosystem, including:
- Web frameworks like FastAPI and Flask
- Data processing libraries like Pandas and NumPy
- Database libraries like SQLAlchemy
- Vector databases like Pinecone and Weaviate

### How do I serve Synalinks programs as an API?

Using FastAPI is the recommended approach:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/query")
async def query_endpoint(request: QueryRequest):
    try:
        result = await program(request.to_input_model())
        return result.dict()
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

### Can I deploy Synalinks on serverless platforms?

Yes, though you need to consider cold start times and timeout limits. For serverless deployments:
1. Use lightweight models when possible
2. Implement caching aggressively
3. Consider provisioned concurrency options
4. Be mindful of memory limitations
